It consists of the following components: • User: A user watches YouTube on devices such as a computer, mobile phone, or smart TV. • Load balancer: A load balancer evenly distributes requests among API servers. • API servers: All user requests go through API servers except video streaming. • Metadata DB: Video metadata are stored in Metadata DB. It is sharded and replicated to meet performance and high availability requirements. • Metadata cache: For better performance, video metadata and user objects are cached. • Original storage: A blob storage system is used to store original videos. A quotation in Wikipedia regarding blob storage shows that: “A Binary Large Object (BLOB) is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system” [6]. • Transcoding servers: Video transcoding is also called video encoding. It is the process of converting a video format to other formats (MPEG, HLS, etc), which provide the best video streams possible for different devices and bandwidth capabilities.
