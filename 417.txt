In Figure 14-8, the original video is split into video, audio, and metadata. Here are some of the tasks that can be applied on a video file: • Inspection: Make sure videos have good quality and are not malformed. • Video encodings: Videos are converted to support different resolutions, codec, bitrates, etc. Figure 14-9 shows an example of video encoded files. • Thumbnail. Thumbnails can either be uploaded by a user or automatically generated by the system. • Watermark: An image overlay on top of your video contains identifying information about your video.
