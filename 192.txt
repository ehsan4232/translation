3. When the memory cache is full or reaches a predefined threshold, data is flushed to SSTable [9] on disk. Note: A sorted-string table (SSTable) is a sorted list of <key, value> pairs. For readers interested in learning more about SStable, refer to the reference material [9]. Read path After a read request is directed to a specific node, it first checks if data is in the memory cache. If so, the data is returned to the client as shown in Figure 6-20. If the data is not in memory, it will be retrieved from the disk instead. We need an efficient way to find out which SSTable contains the key. Bloom filter [10] is commonly used to solve this problem. The read path is shown in Figure 6-21 when data is not in memory. 1. The system first checks if data is in memory. If not, go to step 2. 2. If data is not in memory, the system checks the bloom filter.
