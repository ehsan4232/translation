A Google software engineer built a tool to visualize Dr. Dean’s numbers. The tool also takes the time factor into consideration. Figures 2-1 shows the visualized latency numbers as of 2020 (source of figures: reference material [3]). By analyzing the numbers in Figure 2-1, we get the following conclusions: • Memory is fast but the disk is slow. • Avoid disk seeks if possible. • Simple compression algorithms are fast. • Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible. • Data centers are usually in different regions, and it takes time to send data between them.
