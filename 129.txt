Consistent hashing Quoted from Wikipedia: "Consistent hashing is a special kind of hashing such that when a hash table is re-sized and consistent hashing is used, only k/n keys need to be remapped on average, where k is the number of keys, and n is the number of slots. In contrast, in most traditional hash tables, a change in the number of array slots causes nearly all keys to be remapped [1]”. Hash space and hash ring Now we understand the definition of consistent hashing, let us find out how it works. Assume SHA-1 is used as the hash function f, and the output range of the hash function is: x0, x1, x2, x3, …, xn. In cryptography, SHA-1’s hash space goes from 0 to 2^160 - 1. That means x0 corresponds to 0, xn corresponds to 2^160 – 1, and all the other hash values in the middle fall between 0 and 2^160 - 1. Figure 5-3 shows the hash space. By collecting both ends, we get a hash ring as shown in Figure 5-4: Hash servers Using the same hash function f, we map servers based on server IP or name onto the ring. Figure 5-5 shows that 4 servers are mapped on the hash ring.
