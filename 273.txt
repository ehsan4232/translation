Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in This section shows the high-level design that supports various notification types: iOS push notification, Android push notification, SMS message, and Email. It is structured as follows: • Different types of notifications • Contact info gathering flow • Notification sending/receiving flow Different types of notifications We start by looking at how each notification type works at a high level. iOS push notification We primary need three components to send an iOS push notification: • Provider. A provider builds and sends notification requests to Apple Push Notification Service (APNS). To construct a push notification, the provider provides the following data: • Device token: This is a unique identifier used for sending push notifications. • Payload: This is a JSON dictionary that contains a notification’s payload. Here is an example: • APNS: This is a remote service provided by Apple to propagate push notifications to iOS devices. • iOS Device: It is the end client, which receives push notifications. Android push notification Android adopts a similar notification flow. Instead of using APNs, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is commonly used to send push notifications to android devices.
