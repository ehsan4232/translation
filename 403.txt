• CDN cost. • When cloud CDN serves a video, you are charged for data transferred out of the CDN. • Let us use Amazon’s CDN CloudFront for cost estimation (Figure 14-2) [3]. Assume 100% of traffic is served from the United States. The average cost per GB is $0.02. For simplicity, we only calculate the cost of video streaming. • 5 million * 5 videos * 0.3GB * $0.02 = $150,000 per day. From the rough cost estimation, we know serving videos from the CDN costs lots of money. Even though cloud providers are willing to lower the CDN costs significantly for big customers, the cost is still substantial. We will discuss ways to reduce CDN costs in deep dive.
