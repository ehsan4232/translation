System architecture diagram Now that we have discussed different technical considerations in designing a key-value store, we can shift our focus on the architecture diagram, shown in Figure 6-17. Main features of the architecture are listed as follows: • Clients communicate with the key-value store through simple APIs: get(key) and put(key, value). • A coordinator is a node that acts as a proxy between the client and the key-value store. • Nodes are distributed on a ring using consistent hashing. • The system is completely decentralized so adding and moving nodes can be automatic. • Data is replicated at multiple nodes. • There is no single point of failure as every node has the same set of responsibilities. As the design is decentralized, each node performs many tasks as presented in Figure 6-18.
