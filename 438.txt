accessed by workers, and the data size is usually small. Thus, caching metadata in memory is a good idea. For video or audio data, we put them in blob storage. Data in temporary storage is freed up once the corresponding video processing is complete. Encoded video Encoded video is the final output of the encoding pipeline. Here is an example of the output: funny_720p.mp4 . System optimizations At this point, you ought to have good understanding about the video uploading flow, video streaming flow and video transcoding. Next, we will refine the system with optimizations, including speed, safety, and cost-saving. Speed optimization: parallelize video uploading Uploading a video as a whole unit is inefficient. We can split a video into smaller chunks by GOP alignment as shown in Figure 14-22. This allows fast resumable uploads when the previous upload failed. The job of splitting a video file by GOP can be implemented by the client to improve the upload speed as shown in Figure 14-23. Speed optimization: place upload centers close to users Another way to improve the upload speed is by setting up multiple upload centers across the
