CHAPTER 2: BACK-OF-THE-ENVELOPE ESTIMATION In a system design interview, sometimes you are asked to estimate system capacity or performance requirements using a back-of-the-envelope estimation. According to Jeff Dean, Google Senior Fellow, “back-of-the-envelope calculations are estimates you create using a combination of thought experiments and common performance numbers to get a good feel for which designs will meet your requirements” [1]. You need to have a good sense of scalability basics to effectively carry out back-of-the- envelope estimation. The following concepts should be well understood: power of two [2], latency numbers every programmer should know, and availability numbers.
