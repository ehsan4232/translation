Step 4 - Wrap up Notifications are indispensable because they keep us posted with important information. It could be a push notification about your favorite movie on Netflix, an email about discounts on new products, or a message about your online shopping payment confirmation. In this chapter, we described the design of a scalable notification system that supports multiple notification formats: push notification, SMS message, and email. We adopted message queues to decouple system components. Besides the high-level design, we dug deep into more components and optimizations. • Reliability: We proposed a robust retry mechanism to minimize the failure rate. • Security: AppKey/appSecret pair is used to ensure only verified clients can send notifications. • Tracking and monitoring: These are implemented in any stage of a notification flow to capture important stats. • Respect user settings: Users may opt-out of receiving notifications. Our system checks user settings first before sending notifications. • Rate limiting: Users will appreciate a frequency capping on the number of notifications they receive. Congratulations on getting this far! Now give yourself a pat on the back. Good job!
