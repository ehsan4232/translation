The upload flow is updated as follows: 1. The client makes a HTTP request to API servers to fetch the pre-signed URL, which gives the access permission to the object identified in the URL. The term pre-signed URL is used by uploading files to Amazon S3. Other cloud service providers might use a different name. For instance, Microsoft Azure blob storage supports the same feature, but call it “Shared Access Signature” [10]. 2. API servers respond with a pre-signed URL. 3. Once the client receives the response, it uploads the video using the pre-signed URL. Safety optimization: protect your videos Many content makers are reluctant to post videos online because they fear their original videos will be stolen. To protect copyrighted videos, we can adopt one of the following three safety options: • Digital rights management (DRM) systems: Three major DRM systems are Apple FairPlay, Google Widevine, and Microsoft PlayReady. • AES encryption: You can encrypt a video and configure an authorization policy. The encrypted video will be decrypted upon playback. This ensures that only authorized users can watch an encrypted video. • Visual watermarking: This is an image overlay on top of your video that contains identifying information for your video. It can be your company logo or company name. Cost-saving optimization CDN is a crucial component of our system. It ensures fast video delivery on a global scale. However, from the back of the envelope calculation, we know CDN is expensive, especially when the data size is large. How can we reduce the cost? Previous research shows that YouTube video streams follow long-tail distribution [11] [12]. It means a few popular videos are accessed frequently but many others have few or no viewers. Based on this observation, we implement a few optimizations: 1. Only serve the most popular videos from CDN and other videos from our high capacity
