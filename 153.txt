Understand the problem and establish design scope There is no perfect design. Each design achieves a specific balance regarding the tradeoffs of the read, write, and memory usage. Another tradeoff has to be made was between consistency and availability. In this chapter, we design a key-value store that comprises of the following characteristics: • The size of a key-value pair is small: less than 10 KB. • Ability to store big data. • High availability: The system responds quickly, even during failures. • High scalability: The system can be scaled to support large data set. • Automatic scaling: The addition/deletion of servers should be automatic based on traffic. • Tunable consistency. • Low latency.
