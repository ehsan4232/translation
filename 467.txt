In Figure 15-8, user 1 and user 2 tries to update the same file at the same time, but user 1’s file is processed by our system first. User 1’s update operation goes through, but, user 2 gets a sync conflict. How can we resolve the conflict for user 2? Our system presents both copies of the same file: user 2’s local copy and the latest version from the server (Figure 15-9). User 2 has the option to merge both files or override one version with the other. While multiple users are editing the same document at the same, it is challenging to keep the document synchronized. Interested readers should refer to the reference material [4] [5]. High-level design Figure 15-10 illustrates the proposed high-level design. Let us examine each component of the system.
