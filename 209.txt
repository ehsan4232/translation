Step 3 - Design deep dive In the high-level design, we discussed various options to design a unique ID generator in distributed systems. We settle on an approach that is based on the Twitter snowflake ID generator. Let us dive deep into the design. To refresh our memory, the design diagram is relisted below. Datacenter IDs and machine IDs are chosen at the startup time, generally fixed once the system is up running. Any changes in datacenter IDs and machine IDs require careful review since an accidental change in those values can lead to ID conflicts. Timestamp and sequence numbers are generated when the ID generator is running. Timestamp The most important 41 bits make up the timestamp section. As timestamps grow with time, IDs are sortable by time. Figure 7-7 shows an example of how binary representation is converted to UTC. You can also convert UTC back to binary representation using a similar method.
