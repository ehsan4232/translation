Workers. Workers are a set of servers that perform asynchronous jobs at regular intervals. They build the trie data structure and store it in Trie DB. Trie Cache. Trie Cache is a distributed cache system that keeps trie in memory for fast read. It takes a weekly snapshot of the DB. Trie DB. Trie DB is the persistent storage. Two options are available to store the data: 1. Document store: Since a new trie is built weekly, we can periodically take a snapshot of it, serialize it, and store the serialized data in the database. Document stores like MongoDB [4] are good fits for serialized data. 2. Key-value store: A trie can be represented in a hash table form [4] by applying the following logic: • Every prefix in the trie is mapped to a key in a hash table. • Data on each trie node is mapped to a value in a hash table. Figure 13-10 shows the mapping between the trie and hash table.
