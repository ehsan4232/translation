In this design, many new components are added in comparison with the previous design. • The notification servers are equipped with two more critical features: authentication and rate-limiting. • We also add a retry mechanism to handle notification failures. If the system fails to send notifications, they are put back in the messaging queue and the workers will retry for a predefined number of times. • Furthermore, notification templates provide a consistent and efficient notification creation process. • Finally, monitoring and tracking systems are added for system health checks and future improvements.
