User: A user uses the application either through a browser or mobile app. Block servers: Block servers upload blocks to cloud storage. Block storage, referred to as block-level storage, is a technology to store data files on cloud-based environments. A file can be split into several blocks, each with a unique hash value, stored in our metadata database. Each block is treated as an independent object and stored in our storage system (S3). To reconstruct a file, blocks are joined in a particular order. As for the block size, we use Dropbox as a reference: it sets the maximal size of a block to 4MB [6]. Cloud storage: A file is split into smaller blocks and stored in cloud storage. Cold storage: Cold storage is a computer system designed for storing inactive data, meaning files are not accessed for a long time. Load balancer: A load balancer evenly distributes requests among API servers. API servers: These are responsible for almost everything other than the uploading flow. API servers are used for user authentication, managing user profile, updating file metadata, etc. Metadata database: It stores metadata of users, files, blocks, versions, etc. Please note that files are stored in the cloud and the metadata database only contains metadata. Metadata cache: Some of the metadata are cached for fast retrieval. Notification service: It is a publisher/subscriber system that allows data to be transferred from notification service to clients as certain events happen. In our specific case, notification service notifies relevant clients when a file is added/edited/removed elsewhere so they can pull the latest changes. Offline backup queue: If a client is offline and cannot pull the latest file changes, the offline
