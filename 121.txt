The rehashing problem If you have n cache servers, a common way to balance the load is to use the following hash method: serverIndex = hash(key) % N, where N is the size of the server pool. Let us use an example to illustrate how it works. As shown in Table 5-1, we have 4 servers and 8 string keys with their hashes. To fetch the server where a key is stored, we perform the modular operation f(key) % 4. For instance, hash(key0) % 4 = 1 means a client must contact server 1 to fetch the cached data. Figure 5-1 shows the distribution of keys based on Table 5-1.
