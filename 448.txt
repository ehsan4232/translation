• Split video error: if older versions of clients cannot split videos by GOP alignment, the entire video is passed to the server. The job of splitting videos is done on the server-side. • Transcoding error: retry. • Preprocessor error: regenerate DAG diagram. • DAG scheduler error: reschedule a task. • Resource manager queue down: use a replica. • Task worker down: retry the task on a new worker. • API server down: API servers are stateless so requests will be directed to a different API server. • Metadata cache server down: data is replicated multiple times. If one node goes down, you can still access other nodes to fetch data. We can bring up a new cache server to replace the dead one. • Metadata DB server down: • Master is down. If the master is down, promote one of the slaves to act as the new master. • Slave is down. If a slave goes down, you can use another slave for reads and bring up another database server to replace the dead one.
