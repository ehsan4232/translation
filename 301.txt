Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope The first set of clarification questions are to understand what the interviewer has in mind when she asks you to design a news feed system. At the very least, you should figure out what features to support. Here is an example of candidate-interviewer interaction: Candidate: Is this a mobile app? Or a web app? Or both? Interviewer: Both Candidate: What are the important features? Interview: A user can publish a post and see her friendsâ€™ posts on the news feed page. Candidate: Is the news feed sorted by reverse chronological order or any particular order such as topic scores? For instance, posts from your close friends have higher scores. Interviewer: To keep things simple, let us assume the feed is sorted by reverse chronological order. Candidate: How many friends can a user have? Interviewer: 5000 Candidate: What is the traffic volume? Interviewer: 10 million DAU Candidate: Can feed contain images, videos, or just text? Interviewer: It can contain media files, including both images and videos. Now you have gathered the requirements, we focus on designing the system.
