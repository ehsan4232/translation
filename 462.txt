You have stopped the fire, but you are still worried about potential data losses in case of storage server outage. You ask around and your backend guru friend Frank told you that many leading companies like Netflix and Airbnb use Amazon S3 for storage. “Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance” [3]. You decide to do some research to see if it is a good fit. After a lot of reading, you gain a good understanding of the S3 storage system and decide to store files in S3.

As shown in Figure 15-6, data can be replicated on the same-region (left side) and cross-region (right side). Redundant files are stored in multiple regions to guard against data loss and ensure availability. A bucket is like a folder in file systems. After putting files in S3, you can finally have a good night's sleep without worrying about data losses. To stop similar problems from happening in the future, you decide to do further research on areas you can improve. Here are a few areas you find: • Load balancer: Add a load balancer to distribute network traffic. A load balancer ensures
