Second, it is possible to have a non-uniform key distribution on the ring. For instance, if servers are mapped to positions listed in Figure 5-11, most of the keys are stored on server 2. However, server 1 and server 3 have no data. A technique called virtual nodes or replicas is used to solve these problems. Virtual nodes A virtual node refers to the real node, and each server is represented by multiple virtual nodes on the ring. In Figure 5-12, both server 0 and server 1 have 3 virtual nodes. The 3 is
