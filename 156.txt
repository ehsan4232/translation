Distributed key-value store A distributed key-value store is also called a distributed hash table, which distributes key- value pairs across many servers. When designing a distributed system, it is important to understand CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) theorem. CAP theorem CAP theorem states it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide more than two of these three guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Let us establish a few definitions. Consistency: consistency means all clients see the same data at the same time no matter which node they connect to. Availability: availability means any client which requests data gets a response even if some of the nodes are down. Partition Tolerance: a partition indicates a communication break between two nodes. Partition tolerance means the system continues to operate despite network partitions. CAP theorem states that one of the three properties must be sacrificed to support 2 of the 3 properties as shown in Figure 6-1. Nowadays, key-value stores are classified based on the two CAP characteristics they support: CP (consistency and partition tolerance) systems: a CP key-value store supports consistency and partition tolerance while sacrificing availability. AP (availability and partition tolerance) systems: an AP key-value store supports availability and partition tolerance while sacrificing consistency. CA (consistency and availability) systems: a CA key-value store supports consistency and
