3b.1.a. and 3b.1.b. Completion handler updates the metadata database and cache when video transcoding is complete. 4. API servers inform the client that the video is successfully uploaded and is ready for streaming. Flow b: update the metadata While a file is being uploaded to the original storage, the client in parallel sends a request to update the video metadata as shown in Figure 14-6. The request contains video metadata, including file name, size, format, etc. API servers update the metadata cache and database. Video streaming flow Whenever you watch a video on YouTube, it usually starts streaming immediately and you do not wait until the whole video is downloaded. Downloading means the whole video is copied to your device, while streaming means your device continuously receives video streams from remote source videos. When you watch streaming videos, your client loads a little bit of data at a time so you can watch videos immediately and continuously. Before we discuss video streaming flow, let us look at an important concept: streaming protocol. This is a standardized way to control data transfer for video streaming. Popular streaming protocols are: • MPEG–DASH. MPEG stands for “Moving Picture Experts Group” and DASH stands for "Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP". • Apple HLS. HLS stands for “HTTP Live Streaming”. • Microsoft Smooth Streaming. • Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS).
