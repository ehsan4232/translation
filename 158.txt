availability while sacrificing partition tolerance. Since network failure is unavoidable, a distributed system must tolerate network partition. Thus, a CA system cannot exist in real- world applications. What you read above is mostly the definition part. To make it easier to understand, let us take a look at some concrete examples. In distributed systems, data is usually replicated multiple times. Assume data are replicated on three replica nodes, n1, n2 and n3 as shown in Figure 6- 2. Ideal situation In the ideal world, network partition never occurs. Data written to n1 is automatically replicated to n2 and n3. Both consistency and availability are achieved. Real-world distributed systems In a distributed system, partitions cannot be avoided, and when a partition occurs, we must choose between consistency and availability. In Figure 6-3, n3 goes down and cannot communicate with n1 and n2. If clients write data to n1 or n2, data cannot be propagated to n3. If data is written to n3 but not propagated to n1 and n2 yet, n1 and n2 would have stale data.
