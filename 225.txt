When n = 7, 62 ^ n = ~3.5 trillion, 3.5 trillion is more than enough to hold 365 billion URLs, so the length of hashValue is 7. We will explore two types of hash functions for a URL shortener. The first one is “hash + collision resolution”, and the second one is “base 62 conversion.” Let us look at them one by one. Hash + collision resolution To shorten a long URL, we should implement a hash function that hashes a long URL to a 7- character string. A straightforward solution is to use well-known hash functions like CRC32, MD5, or SHA-1. The following table compares the hash results after applying different hash functions on this URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design. As shown in Table 8-2, even the shortest hash value (from CRC32) is too long (more than 7 characters). How can we make it shorter? The first approach is to collect the first 7 characters of a hash value; however, this method can lead to hash collisions. To resolve hash collisions, we can recursively append a new predefined string until no more collision is discovered. This process is explained in Figure 8-
