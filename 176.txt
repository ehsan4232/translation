A better solution is to use decentralized failure detection methods like gossip protocol. Gossip protocol works as follows: • Each node maintains a node membership list, which contains member IDs and heartbeat counters. • Each node periodically increments its heartbeat counter. • Each node periodically sends heartbeats to a set of random nodes, which in turn propagate to another set of nodes. • Once nodes receive heartbeats, membership list is updated to the latest info. • If the heartbeat has not increased for more than predefined periods, the member is considered as offline.
