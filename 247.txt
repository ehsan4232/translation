URL Filter The URL filter excludes certain content types, file extensions, error links and URLs in “blacklisted” sites. URL Seen? “URL Seen?” is a data structure that keeps track of URLs that are visited before or already in the Frontier. “URL Seen?” helps to avoid adding the same URL multiple times as this can increase server load and cause potential infinite loops. Bloom filter and hash table are common techniques to implement the “URL Seen?” component. We will not cover the detailed implementation of the bloom filter and hash table here. For more information, refer to the reference materials [4] [8]. URL Storage URL Storage stores already visited URLs. So far, we have discussed every system component. Next, we put them together to explain the workflow. Web crawler workflow To better explain the workflow step-by-step, sequence numbers are added in the design diagram as shown in Figure 9-4.
