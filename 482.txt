bring another database server to replace the failed one. • Notification service failure: Every online user keeps a long poll connection with the notification server. Thus, each notification server is connected with many users. According to the Dropbox talk in 2012 [6], over 1 million connections are open per machine. If a server goes down, all the long poll connections are lost so clients must reconnect to a different server. Even though one server can keep many open connections, it cannot reconnect all the lost connections at once. Reconnecting with all the lost clients is a relatively slow process. • Offline backup queue failure: Queues are replicated multiple times. If one queue fails, consumers of the queue may need to re-subscribe to the backup queue.
