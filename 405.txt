Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in As discussed previously, the interviewer recommended leveraging existing cloud services instead of building everything from scratch. CDN and blob storage are the cloud services we will leverage. Some readers might ask why not building everything by ourselves? Reasons are listed below: • System design interviews are not about building everything from scratch. Within the limited time frame, choosing the right technology to do a job right is more important than explaining how the technology works in detail. For instance, mentioning blob storage for storing source videos is enough for the interview. Talking about the detailed design for blob storage could be an overkill. • Building scalable blob storage or CDN is extremely complex and costly. Even large companies like Netflix or Facebook do not build everything themselves. Netflix leverages Amazon’s cloud services [4], and Facebook uses Akamai’s CDN [5]. At the high-level, the system comprises three components (Figure 14-3). Client: You can watch YouTube on your computer, mobile phone, and smartTV. CDN: Videos are stored in CDN. When you press play, a video is streamed from the CDN. API servers: Everything else except video streaming goes through API servers. This includes feed recommendation, generating video upload URL, updating metadata database and cache, user signup, etc. In the question/answer session, the interviewer showed interests in two flows: • Video uploading flow • Video streaming flow We will explore the high-level design for each of them. Video uploading flow Figure 14-4 shows the high-level design for the video uploading.
