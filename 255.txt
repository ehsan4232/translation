• Queue router: It ensures that each queue (b1, b2, … bn) only contains URLs from the same host. • Mapping table: It maps each host to a queue. • FIFO queues b1, b2 to bn: Each queue contains URLs from the same host. • Queue selector: Each worker thread is mapped to a FIFO queue, and it only downloads URLs from that queue. The queue selection logic is done by the Queue selector. • Worker thread 1 to N. A worker thread downloads web pages one by one from the same host. A delay can be added between two download tasks. Priority A random post from a discussion forum about Apple products carries very different weight than posts on the Apple home page. Even though they both have the “Apple” keyword, it is sensible for a crawler to crawl the Apple home page first. We prioritize URLs based on usefulness, which can be measured by PageRank [10], website traffic, update frequency, etc. “Prioritizer” is the component that handles URL prioritization. Refer to the reference materials [5] [10] for in-depth information about this concept. Figure 9-7 shows the design that manages URL priority.
