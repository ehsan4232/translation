Figure 14-5 shows how to upload the actual video. The explanation is shown below: 1. Videos are uploaded to the original storage. 2. Transcoding servers fetch videos from the original storage and start transcoding. 3. Once transcoding is complete, the following two steps are executed in parallel: 3a. Transcoded videos are sent to transcoded storage. 3b. Transcoding completion events are queued in the completion queue. 3a.1. Transcoded videos are distributed to CDN. 3b.1. Completion handler contains a bunch of workers that continuously pull event data from the queue.
