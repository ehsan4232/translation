environment, implementing a unique ID generator is challenging. Luckily, we have already discussed a few solutions in “Chapter 7: Design A Unique ID Generator in Distributed Systems”. You can refer back to it to refresh your memory. URL redirecting deep dive Figure 8-8 shows the detailed design of the URL redirecting. As there are more reads than writes, <shortURL, longURL> mapping is stored in a cache to improve performance. The flow of URL redirecting is summarized as follows: 1. A user clicks a short URL link: https://tinyurl.com/zn9edcu 2. The load balancer forwards the request to web servers. 3. If a shortURL is already in the cache, return the longURL directly. 4. If a shortURL is not in the cache, fetch the longURL from the database. If it is not in the database, it is likely a user entered an invalid shortURL. 5. The longURL is returned to the user.
