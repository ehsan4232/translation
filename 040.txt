Data centers Figure 1-15 shows an example setup with two data centers. In normal operation, users are geoDNS-routed, also known as geo-routed, to the closest data center, with a split traffic of x% in US-East and (100 â€“ x)% in US-West. geoDNS is a DNS service that allows domain names to be resolved to IP addresses based on the location of a user. In the event of any significant data center outage, we direct all traffic to a healthy data center. In Figure 1-16, data center 2 (US-West) is offline, and 100% of the traffic is routed to data center 1 (US-East).
