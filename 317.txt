Step 4 - Wrap up In this chapter, we designed a news feed system. Our design contains two flows: feed publishing and news feed retrieval. Like any system design interview questions, there is no perfect way to design a system. Every company has its unique constraints, and you must design a system to fit those constraints. Understanding the tradeoffs of your design and technology choices are important. If there are a few minutes left, you can talk about scalability issues. To avoid duplicated discussion, only high-level talking points are listed below. Scaling the database: • Vertical scaling vs Horizontal scaling • SQL vs NoSQL • Master-slave replication • Read replicas • Consistency models • Database sharding Other talking points: • Keep web tier stateless • Cache data as much as you can • Support multiple data centers • Lose couple components with message queues • Monitor key metrics. For instance, QPS during peak hours and latency while users refreshing their news feed are interesting to monitor. Congratulations on getting this far! Now give yourself a pat on the back. Good job!
