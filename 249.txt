Step 1: Add seed URLs to the URL Frontier Step 2: HTML Downloader fetches a list of URLs from URL Frontier. Step 3: HTML Downloader gets IP addresses of URLs from DNS resolver and starts downloading. Step 4: Content Parser parses HTML pages and checks if pages are malformed. Step 5: After content is parsed and validated, it is passed to the “Content Seen?” component. Step 6: “Content Seen” component checks if a HTML page is already in the storage. • If it is in the storage, this means the same content in a different URL has already been processed. In this case, the HTML page is discarded. • If it is not in the storage, the system has not processed the same content before. The content is passed to Link Extractor. Step 7: Link extractor extracts links from HTML pages. Step 8: Extracted links are passed to the URL filter. Step 9: After links are filtered, they are passed to the “URL Seen?” component. Step 10: “URL Seen” component checks if a URL is already in the storage, if yes, it is processed before, and nothing needs to be done. Step 11: If a URL has not been processed before, it is added to the URL Frontier.
