Latency numbers every programmer should know Dr. Dean from Google reveals the length of typical computer operations in 2010 [1]. Some numbers are outdated as computers become faster and more powerful. However, those numbers should still be able to give us an idea of the fastness and slowness of different computer operations. Notes ----------- ns = nanosecond, µs = microsecond, ms = millisecond 1 ns = 10^-9 seconds 1 µs= 10^-6 seconds = 1,000 ns 1 ms = 10^-3 seconds = 1,000 µs = 1,000,000 ns
