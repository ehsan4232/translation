HTML Downloader The HTML downloader downloads web pages from the internet. Those URLs are provided by the URL Frontier. DNS Resolver To download a web page, a URL must be translated into an IP address. The HTML Downloader calls the DNS Resolver to get the corresponding IP address for the URL. For instance, URL www.wikipedia.org is converted to IP address 198.35.26.96 as of 3/5/2019. Content Parser After a web page is downloaded, it must be parsed and validated because malformed web pages could provoke problems and waste storage space. Implementing a content parser in a crawl server will slow down the crawling process. Thus, the content parser is a separate component. Content Seen? Online research [6] reveals that 29% of the web pages are duplicated contents, which may cause the same content to be stored multiple times. We introduce the “Content Seen?” data structure to eliminate data redundancy and shorten processing time. It helps to detect new content previously stored in the system. To compare two HTML documents, we can compare them character by character. However, this method is slow and time-consuming, especially when billions of web pages are involved. An efficient way to accomplish this task is to compare the hash values of the two web pages [7]. Content Storage It is a storage system for storing HTML content. The choice of storage system depends on factors such as data type, data size, access frequency, life span, etc. Both disk and memory are used. • Most of the content is stored on disk because the data set is too big to fit in memory. • Popular content is kept in memory to reduce latency. URL Extractor URL Extractor parses and extracts links from HTML pages. Figure 9-3 shows an example of a link extraction process. Relative paths are converted to absolute URLs by adding the “https://en.wikipedia.org” prefix.
