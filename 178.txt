• Node s0 maintains a node membership list shown on the left side. • Node s0 notices that node s2’s (member ID = 2) heartbeat counter has not increased for a long time. • Node s0 sends heartbeats that include s2’s info to a set of random nodes. Once other nodes confirm that s2’s heartbeat counter has not been updated for a long time, node s2 is marked down, and this information is propagated to other nodes. Handling temporary failures After failures have been detected through the gossip protocol, the system needs to deploy certain mechanisms to ensure availability. In the strict quorum approach, read and write operations could be blocked as illustrated in the quorum consensus section. A technique called “sloppy quorum” [4] is used to improve availability. Instead of enforcing the quorum requirement, the system chooses the first W healthy servers for writes and first R healthy servers for reads on the hash ring. Offline servers are ignored. If a server is unavailable due to network or server failures, another server will process requests temporarily. When the down server is up, changes will be pushed back to achieve data consistency. This process is called hinted handoff. Since s2 is unavailable in Figure 6- 12, reads and writes will be handled by s3 temporarily. When s2 comes back online, s3 will hand the data back to s2.
