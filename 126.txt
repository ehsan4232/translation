As shown in Figure 5-2, most keys are redistributed, not just the ones originally stored in the offline server (server 1). This means that when server 1 goes offline, most cache clients will connect to the wrong servers to fetch data. This causes a storm of cache misses. Consistent hashing is an effective technique to mitigate this problem.
