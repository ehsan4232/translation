Let us take a look at the design: • A user gets the IP address of the load balancer from DNS. • A user connects the load balancer with this IP address. • The HTTP request is routed to either Server 1 or Server 2. • A web server reads user data from a slave database. • A web server routes any data-modifying operations to the master database. This includes write, update, and delete operations. Now, you have a solid understanding of the web and data tiers, it is time to improve the load/response time. This can be done by adding a cache layer and shifting static content (JavaScript/CSS/image/video files) to the content delivery network (CDN).
