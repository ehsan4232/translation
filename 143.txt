arbitrarily chosen; and in real-world systems, the number of virtual nodes is much larger. Instead of using s0, we have s0_0, s0_1, and s0_2 to represent server 0 on the ring. Similarly, s1_0, s1_1, and s1_2 represent server 1 on the ring. With virtual nodes, each server is responsible for multiple partitions. Partitions (edges) with label s0 are managed by server 0. On the other hand, partitions with label s1 are managed by server 1. To find which server a key is stored on, we go clockwise from the key’s location and find the first virtual node encountered on the ring. In Figure 5-13, to find out which server k0 is stored on, we go clockwise from k0’s location and find virtual node s1_1, which refers to server 1.
