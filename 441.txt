globe (Figure 14-24). People in the United States can upload videos to the North America upload center, and people in China can upload videos to the Asian upload center. To achieve this, we use CDN as upload centers. Speed optimization: parallelism everywhere Achieving low latency requires serious efforts. Another optimization is to build a loosely coupled system and enable high parallelism. Our design needs some modifications to achieve high parallelism. Let us zoom in to the flow of how a video is transferred from original storage to the CDN. The flow is shown in Figure 14-25, revealing that the output depends on the input of the previous step. This dependency makes parallelism difficult. To make the system more loosely coupled, we introduced message queues as shown in Figure
