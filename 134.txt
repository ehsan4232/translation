To determine which server a key is stored on, we go clockwise from the key position on the ring until a server is found. Figure 5-7 explains this process. Going clockwise, key0 is stored on server 0; key1 is stored on server 1; key2 is stored on server 2 and key3 is stored on server 3. Add a server Using the logic described above, adding a new server will only require redistribution of a fraction of keys. In Figure 5-8, after a new server 4 is added, only key0 needs to be redistributed. k1, k2, and k3 remain on the same servers. Let us take a close look at the logic. Before server 4 is added, key0 is stored on server 0. Now, key0 will be stored on server 4 because server 4 is the first server it encounters by going clockwise from key0â€™s position on the ring. The other keys are not redistributed based on consistent hashing algorithm.
