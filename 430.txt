The resource manager is responsible for managing the efficiency of resource allocation. It contains 3 queues and a task scheduler as shown in Figure 14-17. • Task queue: It is a priority queue that contains tasks to be executed. • Worker queue: It is a priority queue that contains worker utilization info. • Running queue: It contains info about the currently running tasks and workers running the tasks. • Task scheduler: It picks the optimal task/worker, and instructs the chosen task worker to execute the job. The resource manager works as follows: • The task scheduler gets the highest priority task from the task queue. • The task scheduler gets the optimal task worker to run the task from the worker queue. • The task scheduler instructs the chosen task worker to run the task. • The task scheduler binds the task/worker info and puts it in the running queue. • The task scheduler removes the job from the running queue once the job is done.
